Ah man, what a year! 2015 has to be my best. Last year I failed to write my resolution. But since that year went so good, I thought not to miss write one now.

2015 in review:

* I've joined [Goodvidio](https://goodvid.io) and that was the best decision I made in 2015. Goodvidio is getting bigger and bigger and that pushes me to become a better programmer and a better professional.
* Lots of travelling. I went to Sofia, Brussels, Cyprus and Athens. Not to mention the usual snowboarding weekend road trips. Unfortunately, our trip to Paris has been canceled due to [November's Paris attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_2015_Paris_attacks). Won't miss next time.
* Made a lot of public speaking. I've prepared [3 presentations](https://slides.com/kostasbariotis/) and made over 5 talks on them. Speaking in conferences is not only about talking to other people. It's also about listening to what others have to say about you.
* Lots of reading. 2015 wasn't so much of tech reading like the years before. I've read a lot of [classics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four), as much as [literature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Saviors_of_God) and [other](https://37signals.com/rework/) [interesting](http://zerotoonebook.com/) [stuff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine).
* I've actively engaged with the local [Nodejs meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Thessaloniki-Node-js-Meetup/) and helped a lot on the processes. Also, shooting and directing the [promo](https://vimeo.com/146544394) [videos](https://vimeo.com/138629583) was so much fun.

<br/>
2015 was a blast for me and I didn't even had any goals set. The only goal was to take as much as I could out of it. But now, I want 2016 to be more structured and goal oriented.

And my goals for 2016:

* I want to travel more. I've found that tech conferences are a great excuse for that.
* Even more reading and writing to my blog. Writing and maintaining a blog is hard. My problem is that I don't want to be publishing stuff that are not perfect and don't meet my reading standards. [But we should laugh at perfection](http://lifehacker.com/5864004/the-done-manifesto-lays-out-13-ground-rules-for-getting-to-done). There is no such thing. As an experiment, I will try to write as much as possible. This has to be the only way to become better. But, there can't be writing without reading and in 2016 I must keep a balance between reading tech oriented and other books. I need not to be left behind in the tech scene but also to start dusty corners of information that I had never seen before.
* I want to speak to an international conference. That it's going to be a challenge and way out my comfort zone. Still, I think, the benefits from doing such a move are going to be huge. I must not miss that opportunity.
* It's been a long time now since I wanted to be in a better physical shape. Unfortunately, 2015 wasn't the year for that. I am following a good diet and I am not eating much of junk no more. But I really need  to invest on the weight lifting more. 2016 will be the year for that.
