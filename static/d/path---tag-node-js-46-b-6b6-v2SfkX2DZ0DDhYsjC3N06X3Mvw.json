They do one thing and they do it well. I've built a ton of sites using Jekyll hosted either on GitHub either somewhere else. They all work pretty much the same way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You describe your content in some common templating language (<a href=\"pugjs.org\">Pug</a>, <a href=\"http://handlebarsjs.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Handlebars</a>, etc)</li>\n<li>While in development, start a local web server and add file \"watchers\" that will listen for content changes and re-render the site</li>\n<li>Finally, you render the whole site in static HTML and deploy. The generator will combine your files and produce a well formed HTML content.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A caveat here is that you have to keep the client side logic separated from the backend. Much like in an architecture where Wordpress is involved. So, pretty much nothing is changing. The difference from having a cached version of Wordpress and content generated with Jekyll is none.</p>\n<h2 id=\"enter-the-new-world-order\"><a href=\"#enter-the-new-world-order\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Enter the new world order</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">React.js</a>! Awww yeah! We've heard about it! It's dominating the Web, but for a reason. There are so many reasons React.js have gained such a hype. Many of the techniques we will discuss here can be easily applied to other frameworks and libraries but React.js can play so nicely with them.</p>\n<p>There is this function called <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-dom-server.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Server Side Rendering</a> where you can produce static HTML content directly from a tree of React.js components. That HTML content will contain the required React.js specific annotations so when the same tree will be loaded on the client, on top of the previously produced content, will know exactly what has to be rendered and what not to. From there, the client side logic can take the lead. Once the user visits a site, the server will respond with the static HTML. Once it's loaded in the user's browser and the user navigates in another route, the client side logic will respond and will render the new page, instead of contacting the server again. The same codebase will be used for the backend as also for the frontend. And that's a game changer.</p>\n<p>So let's see the new list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Describe your content in React.js Components</li>\n<li>On development time, write code like a boss (hot reloading, modularized code, webpack plugins, etc...)</li>\n<li>Use React.js SSR API to produce the static content to be served on the backend, as well as the frontend side assets to be used on the visitor's browser</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"wait-what-like-that\"><a href=\"#wait-what-like-that\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Wait, what? Like that?</h2>\n<p>Yeah, I know. I made it look so easy. It's not. There is the need for a strong abstraction that will track your links across your components, parse content written in another format, like blog posts written in Markdown, generate code that will not bloat the client and will efficiently serve the content to the user.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, there are a few projects that took the initiative and they are doing a great job so far. At the time of reading this, this site will already be served by GitHub pages and the content you will see once you view the source it's been generated by <a href=\"https://gatsbyjs.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gatsby.js</a>.</p>\n<p>I have been following those projects for quite a while. Here's my list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gatsbyjs.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gatsby.js</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://phenomic.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Phenomic</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nextein.now.sh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nextein</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the time that I started following them, all of them were in a very early stage and none of them could generate my site's content the way I wanted and in the same way as my previous one so to not lose paths and certain functionalities. I wanted to make the generated site, exactly like the old one in terms of the user experience. Once Gatsby.js hit major version 1, I started using it and the result..., you are looking at it!</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-exactly-am-i-looking-at\"><a href=\"#what-exactly-am-i-looking-at\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What exactly am I looking at?</h2>\n<p>First, if you navigate around my site, you will notice that the browser doesn't fully re-renders the site. Gatsby will generate a JSON file for each route, so the browser can request only that file and React.js will render only the appropriate components. (Previously, I was using a technique called <a href=\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com__ghost-theme/blob/master/src/js/app.js#L11\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">pjax</a> to create the same effect. While it looked the same, it was more hack-ish.)</p>\n<p>Second, you can take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">source code</a>. While you need some knowledge of how Gatsby works, let me give you a sense of how this site is being generated. You can find all my blog posts and the main pages(<code class=\"language-text\">/</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">/about</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">/drafts</code>) of this site at <a href=\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/src/pages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><code class=\"language-text\">/src/pages</code></a>. Common components can be found at <a href=\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/src/components\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><code class=\"language-text\">/src/components</code></a>. At <a href=\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/gatsby-node.js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><code class=\"language-text\">/gatsby-node.js</code></a> you can find the route it takes in order to render the site. First, it loads all posts using the GraphQL api which queries all <code class=\"language-text\">.md</code> files. Then it creates a page for each one, using the <a href=\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/src/templates/blog-post.js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><code class=\"language-text\">/src/templates/blog-post.js</code></a> template and before that it creates a page, with pagination, for all posts and tags again using the appropriate template file.</p>\n<p>On development, Gatsby will generate all of these in memory and fire up a development server that I can use to preview my site.</p>\n<p>You can try it your self by cloning the <a href=\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">source code</a> and after installing dependencies, hit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">npm run develop</code> to fire up the development server</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">npm run build</code> to build the site (check the <code class=\"language-text\">/public</code> folder after its done)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"an-alternative-to-html-caching\"><a href=\"#an-alternative-to-html-caching\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>An alternative to HTML caching</h2>\n<p>Static site generation can be seen as another form of caching your content. Think of when you are caching the home page of a Wordpress powered site and you are serving the cached content to every visitor. The thing though is that in many cases, there is no need for a system like Wordpress at all.</p>\n<p>My personal site contains a list of blog posts and static information about me that I am updating it once in a while. Comments are being hosted on <a href=\"https://disqus.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Disqus</a>. There is absolutely no need for a system like Wordpress or even a system like <a href=\"https://ghost.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ghost</a> which I have been using for the last 3 years. While it served me well all this time, I really got tired of updating it, ssh-ing to the server, doing migrations and doing other ops required by such a stack. While there are also options for hosting in the cloud, pretty much they will be paid and fairly enough, they deserve it for doing such a job.</p>\n<p>But do I need a system like that? Not at all. And while we all know how much important that Wordpress' Admin UI is to maintain our content, I would argue that we can separate the backend from the frontend and have lots of new features built in automatically. Imagine that instead of having <a href=\"https://memcached.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">memcached</a> caching your HTML in front of your WordPress site, you trigger a hook each time your database changes that will re-generate the frontend using <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gatsby</a>. Yes, Gatsby supports multiple backend sources to load your content. Instead of storing them inside your VCS like me, you can as well load them from your Wordpress's MySQL database.</p>\n<p>To conclude, modern static generators will allow us to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>serve static content without maintaining complex stacks</li>\n<li>keep a clear separation between the backend and the frontend</li>\n<li>have cool features like client side routing and hot reload on development, out of the box</li>\n<li>reuse the same code that is being used to generate the backend content at our visitors' browsers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hope that you will experiment with Gatsby and you will let me know what you think.</p>","id":"99edb8e5-d1d2-57ec-b131-f0e27fecffc3","timeToRead":6,"frontmatter":{"date":"2017-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","path":"/modern-static-site-generation/","tags":"node.js, reactjs, javascript","title":"Modern static site generation","draft":null}},{"excerpt":"It all started when  Adonis  told me that he was looking to contribute to some open source projects.

Databases change very often and contain data that can even disintegrate our whole application if they get out of sync. Changing a live database, whether it's related to schema or data, can be hard. Modern apps, where Agile methodologies along with processes such as <a href=\"http://continuousdelivery.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Continuous Integration</a> apply, have raised the bar of complexity so maintaining a database separately from the application's business logic can be quite painful.</p>\n<p>Fortunately, we have <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schema_migration\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Database Migrations</a>, a technique to help us keep our database changes under control.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-problem\"><a href=\"#the-problem\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The problem</h2>\n<p>Problems I have seen over the years:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Apps often need certain data to be in place in order to run. In a fresh environment, a team member may not have those or may need to import a subset of the production database.</li>\n<li>Different instances of databases, such as production, stage, local environments, may get out of sync.</li>\n<li>Multiple environments setups raise the complexity of different databases versions running at the same time</li>\n<li>Continuous delivery needs repeatable and testable tasks</li>\n<li>When a developer puts his/her hands in the DB, that change will be lost forever. Code evolves along with our Schema so keeping changes tracked is quite a necessity</li>\n<li>Data integrity after updates</li>\n<li>Rollbacks are our safety net of broken deployments. You can’t rollback your app when your data will be out of order.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Shorter release cycles often require database changes. Having those changes under version control allows us to make changes safely and in a more consistent way. A crucial part of following such methodologies is the evolutionary design which can help us keep track of how the database evolved along with our application. That way our data can rollback at any point of the history hand in hand with our app.</p>\n<p>Evolving our database design along with our core functioning data during the application development, and doing that in a seamless way, requires the use of more sophisticated processes like Database migrations, which essentially are the management of incremental, reversible changes to our databases.</p>\n<p>Database migrations are all about treating our database as another piece of code while applying core principles of Continuous Integration. Publishing new features along with the database changes, without requiring manual Ops work and removing any hands-on session from the DB is the way to move forward and create robust apps.</p>\n<p>This article will walk you through the different types of migrations, how they are being used and how to write DB migrations in a Nodejs environment.</p>\n<p>Let's explore the types of database migrations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"types-of-migrations\"><a href=\"#types-of-migrations\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Types of Migrations</h2>\n<p>Database migrations usually have two forms.

For example, when we add an Index, removing/adding a field or restructuring the current fields, moving one from being a String into an Integer.\nThis could also mean that we may need to restructure the data that is already in the database, which brings us to the second form of migrations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"migrating-data\"><a href=\"#migrating-data\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Migrating data</h3>\n<p>In a production environment, where data is already in the DB, we may have to migrate those as well. Same cases apply to testing and staging environments but production is a more fragile universe where mistakes are not forgiven.  Say we need to split the <code class=\"language-text\">Name</code> field of our Users table into a <code class=\"language-text\">First/Last Name</code> fields combination. One approach would be to create a field called <code class=\"language-text\">Last Name</code>. Traverse the table, split the <code class=\"language-text\">Name</code> into two chunks and move the latter to the newly created field. Finally, rename the <code class=\"language-text\">Name</code> field into <code class=\"language-text\">First Name</code>. This is a case of data migrations.</p>\n<p>But how do we handle this without putting our hands in the DB?</p>\n<h2 id=\"automation-is-the-key\"><a href=\"#automation-is-the-key\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Automation is the key</h2>\n<p>We must be able to describe our database and the migrations with code.

Let's see those using Node.js:</p>\n<h3 id=\"write-a-migration\"><a href=\"#write-a-migration\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Write a migration</h3>\n<p>Usually, we want to define two standard methods for a migration script.

There could be heavy changes where a developer couldn't handle and a DBA should come, but for rapid changes, migrations will serve us right, especially when we seeking for faster release cycles and keeping track of our Database changes.</p>\n<p>I am sure that your system handles migration somehow, search it up if you have never thought of it.</p>\n<p>In case you are already doing migrations, what is your preferred workflow?

They do one thing and they do it well. I've built a ton of sites using Jekyll hosted either on GitHub either somewhere else. They all work pretty much the same way:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>You describe your content in some common templating language (<a href=\"pugjs.org\">Pug</a>, <a href=\"http://handlebarsjs.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Handlebars</a>, etc)</li>\n<li>While in development, start a local web server and add file \"watchers\" that will listen for content changes and re-render the site</li>\n<li>Finally, you render the whole site in static HTML and deploy. The generator will combine your files and produce a well formed HTML content.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A caveat here is that you have to keep the client side logic separated from the backend. Much like in an architecture where Wordpress is involved. So, pretty much nothing is changing. The difference from having a cached version of Wordpress and content generated with Jekyll is none.</p>\n<h2 id=\"enter-the-new-world-order\"><a href=\"#enter-the-new-world-order\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Enter the new world order</h2>\n<p><a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">React.js</a>! Awww yeah! We've heard about it! It's dominating the Web, but for a reason. There are so many reasons React.js have gained such a hype. Many of the techniques we will discuss here can be easily applied to other frameworks and libraries but React.js can play so nicely with them.</p>\n<p>There is this function called <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/react-dom-server.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Server Side Rendering</a> where you can produce static HTML content directly from a tree of React.js components. That HTML content will contain the required React.js specific annotations so when the same tree will be loaded on the client, on top of the previously produced content, will know exactly what has to be rendered and what not to. From there, the client side logic can take the lead. Once the user visits a site, the server will respond with the static HTML. Once it's loaded in the user's browser and the user navigates in another route, the client side logic will respond and will render the new page, instead of contacting the server again. The same codebase will be used for the backend as also for the frontend. And that's a game changer.</p>\n<p>So let's see the new list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Describe your content in React.js Components</li>\n<li>On development time, write code like a boss (hot reloading, modularized code, webpack plugins, etc...)</li>\n<li>Use React.js SSR API to produce the static content to be served on the backend, as well as the frontend side assets to be used on the visitor's browser</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"wait-what-like-that\"><a href=\"#wait-what-like-that\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Wait, what? Like that?</h2>\n<p>Yeah, I know. I made it look so easy. It's not. There is the need for a strong abstraction that will track your links across your components, parse content written in another format, like blog posts written in Markdown, generate code that will not bloat the client and will efficiently serve the content to the user.</p>\n<p>Thankfully, there are a few projects that took the initiative and they are doing a great job so far. At the time of reading this, this site will already be served by GitHub pages and the content you will see once you view the source it's been generated by <a href=\"https://gatsbyjs.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gatsby.js</a>.</p>\n<p>I have been following those projects for quite a while. Here's my list:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://gatsbyjs.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gatsby.js</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://phenomic.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Phenomic</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nextein.now.sh\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">nextein</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the time that I started following them, all of them were in a very early stage and none of them could generate my site's content the way I wanted and in the same way as my previous one so to not lose paths and certain functionalities. I wanted to make the generated site, exactly like the old one in terms of the user experience. Once Gatsby.js hit major version 1, I started using it and the result..., you are looking at it!</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-exactly-am-i-looking-at\"><a href=\"#what-exactly-am-i-looking-at\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What exactly am I looking at?</h2>\n<p>First, if you navigate around my site, you will notice that the browser doesn't fully re-renders the site. Gatsby will generate a JSON file for each route, so the browser can request only that file and React.js will render only the appropriate components.

While it looked the same, it was more hack-ish.)</p>\n<p>Second, you can take a look at the <a href=\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">source code</a>. While you need some knowledge of how Gatsby works, let me give you a sense of how this site is being generated. You can find all my blog posts and the main pages(<code class=\"language-text\">/</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">/about</code>, <code class=\"language-text\">/drafts</code>) of this site at <a href=\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/src/pages\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><code class=\"language-text\">/src/pages</code></a>. Common components can be found at <a href=\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/src/components\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><code class=\"language-text\">/src/components</code></a>. At <a href=\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/gatsby-node.js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><code class=\"language-text\">/gatsby-node.js</code></a> you can find the route it takes in order to render the site. First, it loads all posts using the GraphQL api which queries all <code class=\"language-text\">.md</code> files. Then it creates a page for each one, using the <a href=\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/tree/master/src/templates/blog-post.js\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><code class=\"language-text\">/src/templates/blog-post.js</code></a> template and before that it creates a page, with pagination, for all posts and tags again using the appropriate template file.</p>\n<p>On development, Gatsby will generate all of these in memory and fire up a development server that I can use to preview my site.</p>\n<p>You can try it your self by cloning the <a href=\"https://github.com/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">source code</a> and after installing dependencies, hit:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">npm run develop</code> to fire up the development server</li>\n<li><code class=\"language-text\">npm run build</code> to build the site (check the <code class=\"language-text\">/public</code> folder after its done)</li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"an-alternative-to-html-caching\"><a href=\"#an-alternative-to-html-caching\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>An alternative to HTML caching</h2>\n<p>Static site generation can be seen as another form of caching your content. Think of when you are caching the home page of a Wordpress powered site and you are serving the cached content to every visitor. The thing though is that in many cases, there is no need for a system like Wordpress at all.</p>\n<p>My personal site contains a list of blog posts and static information about me that I am updating it once in a while. Comments are being hosted on <a href=\"https://disqus.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Disqus</a>. There is absolutely no need for a system like Wordpress or even a system like <a href=\"https://ghost.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Ghost</a> which I have been using for the last 3 years. While it served me well all this time, I really got tired of updating it, ssh-ing to the server, doing migrations and doing other ops required by such a stack. While there are also options for hosting in the cloud, pretty much they will be paid and fairly enough, they deserve it for doing such a job.</p>\n<p>But do I need a system like that? Not at all. And while we all know how much important that Wordpress' Admin UI is to maintain our content, I would argue that we can separate the backend from the frontend and have lots of new features built in automatically. Imagine that instead of having <a href=\"https://memcached.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">memcached</a> caching your HTML in front of your WordPress site, you trigger a hook each time your database changes that will re-generate the frontend using <a href=\"https://www.gatsbyjs.org/packages/gatsby-source-wordpress/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Gatsby</a>. Yes, Gatsby supports multiple backend sources to load your content. Instead of storing them inside your VCS like me, you can as well load them from your Wordpress's MySQL database.</p>\n<p>To conclude, modern static generators will allow us to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>serve static content without maintaining complex stacks</li>\n<li>keep a clear separation between the backend and the frontend</li>\n<li>have cool features like client side routing and hot reload on development, out of the box</li>\n<li>reuse the same code that is being used to generate the backend content at our visitors' browsers</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Hope that you will experiment with Gatsby and you will let me know what you think.</p>","id":"99edb8e5-d1d2-57ec-b131-f0e27fecffc3","timeToRead":6,"frontmatter":{"date":"2017-08-18T00:00:00.000Z","path":"/modern-static-site-generation/","tags":"node.js, reactjs, javascript","title":"Modern static site generation","draft":null}},{"excerpt":"It all started when  Adonis  told me that he was looking to contribute to some open source projects.

Code evolves along with our Schema so keeping changes tracked is quite a necessity</li>\n<li>Data integrity after updates</li>\n<li>Rollbacks are our safety net of broken deployments. You can’t rollback your app when your data will be out of order.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Shorter release cycles often require database changes. Having those changes under version control allows us to make changes safely and in a more consistent way. A crucial part of following such methodologies is the evolutionary design which can help us keep track of how the database evolved along with our application. That way our data can rollback at any point of the history hand in hand with our app.</p>\n<p>Evolving our database design along with our core functioning data during the application development, and doing that in a seamless way, requires the use of more sophisticated processes like Database migrations, which essentially are the management of incremental, reversible changes to our databases.</p>\n<p>Database migrations are all about treating our database as another piece of code while applying core principles of Continuous Integration. Publishing new features along with the database changes, without requiring manual Ops work and removing any hands-on session from the DB is the way to move forward and create robust apps.</p>\n<p>This article will walk you through the different types of migrations, how they are being used and how to write DB migrations in a Nodejs environment.</p>\n<p>Let's explore the types of database migrations.</p>\n<h2 id=\"types-of-migrations\"><a href=\"#types-of-migrations\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Types of Migrations</h2>\n<p>Database migrations usually have two forms.

For example, when we add an Index, removing/adding a field or restructuring the current fields, moving one from being a String into an Integer.\nThis could also mean that we may need to restructure the data that is already in the database, which brings us to the second form of migrations.</p>\n<h3 id=\"migrating-data\"><a href=\"#migrating-data\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Migrating data</h3>\n<p>In a production environment, where data is already in the DB, we may have to migrate those as well. Same cases apply to testing and staging environments but production is a more fragile universe where mistakes are not forgiven.  Say we need to split the <code class=\"language-text\">Name</code> field of our Users table into a <code class=\"language-text\">First/Last Name</code> fields combination. One approach would be to create a field called <code class=\"language-text\">Last Name</code>. Traverse the table, split the <code class=\"language-text\">Name</code> into two chunks and move the latter to the newly created field. Finally, rename the <code class=\"language-text\">Name</code> field into <code class=\"language-text\">First Name</code>. This is a case of data migrations.</p>\n<p>But how do we handle this without putting our hands in the DB?</p>\n<h2 id=\"automation-is-the-key\"><a href=\"#automation-is-the-key\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Automation is the key</h2>\n<p>We must be able to describe our database and the migrations with code.

But instead of interacting directly with a database, you have to use the API to make your changes.</p>\n<h2 id=\"migrations-dive-with-nodejs\"><a href=\"#migrations-dive-with-nodejs\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Migrations dive with Nodejs</h2>\n<p>Applications built with Nodejs have no differences from any other stack.</p>\n<p>After doing a little research, I ended up using <a href=\"https://github.com/sequelize/umzug\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">umzug</a> which provides a nice programmatic API to make your migrations.

There could be heavy changes where a developer couldn't handle and a DBA should come, but for rapid changes, migrations will serve us right, especially when we seeking for faster release cycles and keeping track of our Database changes.</p>\n<p>I am sure that your system handles migration somehow, search it up if you have never thought of it.</p>\n<p>In case you are already doing migrations, what is your preferred workflow?

At first, we call our function without a parameter so the first condition will be true and an error will be thrown. Then we stub the <code class=\"language-text\">request</code> object so it will run the callback function with an error. This will trigger the second condition and reject our promise. Inside the <code class=\"language-text\">catch</code> function, we know that the promise has been rejected. For the end, we stub the callback to return with a null error and a body that will resolve the promise and we test that inside the <code class=\"language-text\">then</code> function. 100% code coverage.</p>\n<p>This way we have completely isolated our Unit Under Test and made it blazingly fast to run since we don't make any actual HTTP requests.

I explained the concept of TDD and described my tools of choice for integrating the TDD flow with Node.js. It was great.</p>\n<p>I didn't got into GUI testing and I saw a major interest on that. So I decided to take a look at the current state of GUI testing. Here are the main tools that I came up with:</p>\n<h2 id=\"zombiejs\"><a href=\"#zombiejs\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Zombie.js</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://zombie.js.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Zombie</a> uses <a href=\"https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">jsdom</a> to parse the required HTML and Javascript and then simulate the desired behaviour. I find it a great tool for testing basic functionality in small apps.</p>\n<p>JSDom will create an in memory representation of the DOM and execute any Javascript dependencies so you can do a real testing scenario. Since it doesn't uses a real browser engine you can't find abnormalities of real world situations. So you can't rely on it for cross browser compatibility.</p>\n<p>I got very frustrated while trying to test AJAX powered pages. For SPA apps, Zombie wouldn't be an ideal solution.</p>\n<h2 id=\"casperjs\"><a href=\"#casperjs\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Casper.js</h2>\n<p><a href=\"http://casperjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Casper</a> on the other hand, is a wrapper around <a href=\"http://phantomjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Phantom.js</a> which utilises a <a href=\"https://webkit.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Webkit</a> headless browser and will do a full rendering of your web page in order to test it. Since you will have a full representation of your site you can even <a href=\"https://github.com/sindresorhus/pageres\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">take screenshots for easier QA</a>.</p>\n<p>Casper.js has neat documentation and it's API is really easy to follow and adopt.</p>\n<h2 id=\"nightwatchjs\"><a href=\"#nightwatchjs\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Nightwatch.js</h2>\n<p>Now, on the heavy side, we have <a href=\"http://www.seleniumhq.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Selenium</a>. Selenium is a set of projects. It started off by auto running browsers and injecting code into them so we can test it. Since then, browsers vendors kept evolving and expose a full set of control over their browsers so Selenium has native support over those, with the <a href=\"http://www.seleniumhq.org/projects/webdriver/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Selenium WebDriver</a>.</p>\n<p>You will have to install all the browsers you need to test locally and then use Selenium to run tests on them. It's pretty basic.</p>\n<p>Selenium's internals and configuration is a bit overcomplicated and if you don't need it, you don't have to get into it. <a href=\"http://nightwatchjs.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nightwatch</a> is a great layer of abstraction on top of Selenium that will do all the heavy work for you.</p>\n<h1 id=\"at-the-end\"><a href=\"#at-the-end\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>At the end</h1>\n<p>I am sure there are tone of other solutions out there.
