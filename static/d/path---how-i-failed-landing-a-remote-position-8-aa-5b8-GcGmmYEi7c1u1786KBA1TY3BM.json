I need myself to be a good fit on the team and the team to be a good fit for me. I don't like big established corporations cause there is almost never anything interesting for me there. I like small ambitious teams, flexible enough to do one week sprints and put all of their heart in every sprint. I want the team's long-term goals to be my long term goals so I can put myself in it.</p>\n<p>I would call them \"startups\" just because it's cool nowadays, but I won't because that's simply not what I am all about. Startups are all about high risk, I am not (at least not at this point).</p>\n<p>While Greece had quite a few success stories of such teams, my hometown Thessaloniki, in northern Greece is not that famous for their startup environment. Leaving Greece wasn't possible at the moment so I thought I would chase a remote position especially after having lots of local friends who work for big companies like, GitHub, Automattic, etc.</p>\n<p>Let one not forget, there is also the compensation parameter that says that you can enter a better-paid market than your local market, which is no debatable for my local market.</p>\n<p>So I thought I would give it a try.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-setup\"><a href=\"#the-setup\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The setup</h2>\n<p>The setup when you do job hunting has everything to do with how you present yourself in the online world. How I present myself you ask? Well, you are looking at it. This web page contains everything you need to know about me, all the projects I am working on, everything I have share with my readers, lots of my views about stuff (ok not everything, but you get the idea). You can find all my social profiles (GitHub, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc) through this web page and lots of other places are linking back to my blog posts.</p>\n<p>But to make the recruiter to visit my page, I had to go through her mailbox first. So I tried to write a catchy email worthy enough to make her click my web page. Keep in mind that I am not targeting a big corporation but rather a team where the casual speech is usual. I wanted to write an email that will automatically filter out the \"serious\" guys and attract the more friendly ones. That's why the friendly tone.</p>\n<p>This is the final version of it because I had to do some revises after I sent it a few times.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Dear Mr/Ms,</p>\n<p>I am Kostas Bariotis, a software developer and a passionate doer. I am sending you my regards from sunny Thessaloniki, Greece. Have you ever been? Take a look, I am sure you will fall in love with the amazing beaches of Chalkidiki.</p>\n<p>I am currently looking for a product and a team that I would be a great fit in. I stumbled upon your job description and I would really love it to talk more with you guys. I have been working with Node.js for the past three years. (<strong>This is where I explain why I would be a good fit for that particular position</strong>)</p>\n<p>I am obsessed with clean and efficient code. I am interested in designing software architectures, APIs and databases to serve the rest of an application. I am a full stack developer yet I love taking a specific field in my hands and getting the juice out of it. I am interested in being a part of a team that builds great software. I have spent the last two years with the <a href=\"https://goodvid.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Goodvid.io</a> team to serve e-commerce sites with curated product videos.</p>\n<p>My blog is my personal playground, I am also doing a lot of public speaking talking a lot about tech stuff and also talking with others on my podcast. Stargento and <a href=\"https://gityeller.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">GitYeller</a> are two of my side projects. You can find more code samples and my contributions on <a href=\"https://github.com/kbariotis\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Github</a>. Along with some folks, we are organizing the local <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Thessaloniki-Node-js-Meetup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nodejs meetup</a> and <a href=\"http://devitconf.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Devit Conf</a>, the biggest web development conference in northern Greece. We are also known as <a href=\"https://skgtech.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SKGTech</a>.</p>\n<p>Last, but not least, I love reading books, mainly science fiction, traveling and attending conferences and meetups, snowboarding and staying fit. Calisthenics class is my latest activity that takes a lot of my time.</p>\n<p>I would love it if we could arrange a talk and talk more about how I could potentially be a fit for your team. Please, consult my resume or see the links below.</p>\n<p>Thank you so much and have a nice day. :)</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2 id=\"where-did-i-look\"><a href=\"#where-did-i-look\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Where did I look?</h2>\n<p>Nowadays there are lots of places to find a remote position, especially in software engineering.

Lots of companies showed interest in me and lots of others didn't even bother contacting me back.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/17w6jiewdPQSgSL3Rripit2RdjWcR_I_m7ObBObmQAh0/edit?usp=sharing\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">I have gathered over 70 applications</a> the months that I was looking for a job. Keep in mind that these are only those that I had some sort of communication through email or some other mean. I also did lots of applications on Angel.co and other similar sites that I've never heard back. The sum of the applications must exceed those 70 by far.</p>\n<h2 id=\"what-i-have-learned\"><a href=\"#what-i-have-learned\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What I have learned</h2>\n<p>The progress I had with each company varies. It's interesting to see how many contacted me back and how many wanted to do an <a href=\"https://kostasbariotis.com/interviewer-vs-interviewee/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">interview</a> and how many interviews did I took on average with each company. I believe, though, that the most interesting part is that with over 70 applications I did, I took back like 3 offers which lead me to the conclusion that the market of the remote positions is highly competitive and it's really hard to find the job that you would be happy enough.</p>\n<p>As you enter a bigger market of potential employers, the same way they enter a bigger market of potential employees. Most of the times, the best yet the cheapest at their fields are those who get hired.</p>\n<p>But that's ok, cause this makes the market grow. There are still these companies that are looking for other parameters and don't care about the cost that much, but these companies have higher expectations and juniors/mid developers are often not being considered that easily.</p>\n<p>I am back on track now on a great team and an amazing environment in the heart of Thessaloniki. I am not rejecting the idea of working remotely entirely but I will leave it aside for now.</p>\n<p>Hope that you liked this post.</p>","excerpt":"I started looking for a remote position, telecommuting in other words, as a software engineer last November.

The same goes for the Sentry access code, different for every environment (Sentry supports error tags though, that's just an example.)</p>\n<p>Great so let's rewrite:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\">\n      <pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> ApolloClient<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span> createNetworkInterface <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'apollo-client'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> gql <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'graphql-tag'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> client <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">ApolloClient</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  networkInterface<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">createNetworkInterface</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    uri<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> __CONFIG__<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>graphql<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>endpoint<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\nRaven<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">config</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>__CONFIG__<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>sentry<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>code<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">install</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\nclient<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">query</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  query<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> gql<span class=\"token template-string\"><span class=\"token string\">`\n    query TodoApp {\n      todos {\n        id\n        text\n        completed\n      }\n    }\n  `</span></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">then</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>data <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> console<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">log</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>data<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token keyword\">catch</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>error <span class=\"token operator\">=></span> Raven<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">captureException</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>error<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Great!

First, we need the configuration management. <a href=\"https://github.com/lorenwest/node-config\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">node-config</a> would be great for this. Just install it, write some configuration files and load it in your webpack configuration like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\">\n      <pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">const config = require(&#39;node-config&#39;);</code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p><code class=\"language-text\">config</code> here will be the environment specific configuration you have defined. Now we need to inject that into our application entry file.</p>\n<p>One way would be to create a module alias. Then you can just import from every file you are going to need it. Although you may need to adjust it a bit to use it with <code class=\"language-text\">node-config</code>, it's fairly simple and works in most cases.</p>\n<p>One caveat here is that the configuration is being imported into your application and just sits there, whether you are using it or not. Configuration values that are not being used are still there, which may even be considered as a security flaw. We don't want that.</p>\n<p>A better solution would be webpack's <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/plugins/define-plugin/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">DefinePlugin</a>. DefinePlugin will replace every occurrence of a key you are passing it with its respective value on compile time.</p>\n<p>So this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\">\n      <pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>__CONFIG__<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>sentry<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>is_enabled<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> Raven <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'raven-js'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  Raven<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">config</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>__CONFIG__<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>sentry<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>code<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">install</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>will become</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\">\n      <pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">if</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token boolean\">false</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  <span class=\"token keyword\">import</span> Raven <span class=\"token keyword\">from</span> <span class=\"token string\">'raven-js'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n  Raven<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">config</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>__CONFIG__<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>sentry<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>code<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">install</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>on the staging environment. What's even greater about that, is that webpack will pass it (using UglifyJS) and completely remove it since it's never going to be used.</p>\n<p>Heads up though!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Note that because the plugin does a direct text replacement, the value given to it must include actual quotes inside of the string itself. Typically, this is done either with either alternate quotes, such as '\"production\"', or by using JSON.stringify('production').</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You need to write your configuration respectively because of that.</p>\n<p>The webpack configuration will look like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\">\n      <pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\"><span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> path <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">require</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'path'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> webpack <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">require</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'webpack'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n<span class=\"token keyword\">const</span> config <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token function\">require</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'config'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span>\n\nmodule<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>exports <span class=\"token operator\">=</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n  entry<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'./index.js'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  plugins<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span>\n    <span class=\"token keyword\">new</span> <span class=\"token class-name\">webpack<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span>DefinePlugin</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n      __CONFIG__<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token function\">packinize</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>config<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n    <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n  output<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">{</span>\n    filename<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">'app.bundle.js'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    path<span class=\"token punctuation\">:</span> <span class=\"token string\">\"/path.join(__dirname, 'dist')/\"</span>\n  <span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">}</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>We pass <code class=\"language-text\">node-config</code> into <code class=\"language-text\">packinize</code> which will pass every value and stringify it.
