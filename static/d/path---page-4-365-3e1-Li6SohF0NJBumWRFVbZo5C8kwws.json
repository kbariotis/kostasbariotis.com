Goodvidio is getting bigger and bigger and that pushes me to become a better programmer and a better professional.</li>\n<li>Lots of travelling. I went to Sofia, Brussels, Cyprus and Athens. Not to mention the usual snowboarding weekend road trips. Unfortunately, our trip to Paris has been canceled due to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_2015_Paris_attacks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">November's Paris attack</a>. Won't miss next time.</li>\n<li>Made a lot of public speaking. I've prepared <a href=\"https://slides.com/kostasbariotis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">3 presentations</a> and made over 5 talks on them. Speaking in conferences is not only about talking to other people. It's also about listening to what others have to say about you.</li>\n<li>Lots of reading. 2015 wasn't so much of tech reading like the years before. I've read a lot of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">classics</a>, as much as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Saviors_of_God\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">literature</a> and <a href=\"https://37signals.com/rework/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">other</a> <a href=\"http://zerotoonebook.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">interesting</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stuff</a>.</li>\n<li>I've actively engaged with the local <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Thessaloniki-Node-js-Meetup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nodejs meetup</a> and helped a lot on the processes. Also, shooting and directing the <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/146544394\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">promo</a> <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/138629583\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">videos</a> was so much fun.</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n2015 was a blast for me and I didn't even had any goals set. The only goal was to take as much as I could out of it. But now, I want 2016 to be more structured and goal oriented.\n<blockquote>\n<p>“If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Benjamin Franklin</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And my goals for 2016:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I want to travel more. I've found that tech conferences are a great excuse for that.</li>\n<li>Even more reading and writing to my blog. Writing and maintaining a blog is hard. My problem is that I don't want to be publishing stuff that are not perfect and don't meet my reading standards. <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5864004/the-done-manifesto-lays-out-13-ground-rules-for-getting-to-done\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">But we should laugh at perfection</a>. There is no such thing. As an experiment, I will try to write as much as possible. This has to be the only way to become better. But, there can't be writing without reading and in 2016 I must keep a balance between reading tech oriented and other books. I need not to be left behind in the tech scene but also to start dusty corners of information that I had never seen before.</li>\n<li>I want to speak to an international conference. That it's going to be a challenge and way out my comfort zone. Still, I think, the benefits from doing such a move are going to be huge. I must not miss that opportunity.</li>\n<li>It's been a long time now since I wanted to be in a better physical shape. Unfortunately, 2015 wasn't the year for that. I am following a good diet and I am not eating much of junk no more. But I really need  to invest on the weight lifting more. 2016 will be the year for that.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Laugh at perfection.

I find it a great tool for testing basic functionality in small apps.</p>\n<p>JSDom will create an in memory representation of the DOM and execute any Javascript dependencies so you can do a real testing scenario. Since it doesn't uses a real browser engine you can't find abnormalities of real world situations. So you can't rely on it for cross browser compatibility.</p>\n<p>I got very frustrated while trying to test AJAX powered pages.

Last year I failed to write my resolution. But since that year went so good, I thought not to miss write one now.</p>\n<p>2015 in review:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I've joined <a href=\"https://goodvid.io\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Goodvidio</a> and that was the best decision I made in 2015. Goodvidio is getting bigger and bigger and that pushes me to become a better programmer and a better professional.</li>\n<li>Lots of travelling. I went to Sofia, Brussels, Cyprus and Athens. Not to mention the usual snowboarding weekend road trips. Unfortunately, our trip to Paris has been canceled due to <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/November_2015_Paris_attacks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">November's Paris attack</a>. Won't miss next time.</li>\n<li>Made a lot of public speaking. I've prepared <a href=\"https://slides.com/kostasbariotis/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">3 presentations</a> and made over 5 talks on them. Speaking in conferences is not only about talking to other people. It's also about listening to what others have to say about you.</li>\n<li>Lots of reading. 2015 wasn't so much of tech reading like the years before. I've read a lot of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nineteen_Eighty-Four\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">classics</a>, as much as <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Saviors_of_God\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">literature</a> and <a href=\"https://37signals.com/rework/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">other</a> <a href=\"http://zerotoonebook.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">interesting</a> <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Shock_Doctrine\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">stuff</a>.</li>\n<li>I've actively engaged with the local <a href=\"http://www.meetup.com/Thessaloniki-Node-js-Meetup/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Nodejs meetup</a> and helped a lot on the processes. Also, shooting and directing the <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/146544394\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">promo</a> <a href=\"https://vimeo.com/138629583\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">videos</a> was so much fun.</li>\n</ul>\n<br/>\n2015 was a blast for me and I didn't even had any goals set. The only goal was to take as much as I could out of it. But now, I want 2016 to be more structured and goal oriented.\n<blockquote>\n<p>“If you fail to plan, you are planning to fail!”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Benjamin Franklin</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>And my goals for 2016:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>I want to travel more. I've found that tech conferences are a great excuse for that.</li>\n<li>Even more reading and writing to my blog. Writing and maintaining a blog is hard. My problem is that I don't want to be publishing stuff that are not perfect and don't meet my reading standards. <a href=\"http://lifehacker.com/5864004/the-done-manifesto-lays-out-13-ground-rules-for-getting-to-done\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">But we should laugh at perfection</a>. There is no such thing. As an experiment, I will try to write as much as possible. This has to be the only way to become better. But, there can't be writing without reading and in 2016 I must keep a balance between reading tech oriented and other books. I need not to be left behind in the tech scene but also to start dusty corners of information that I had never seen before.</li>\n<li>I want to speak to an international conference. That it's going to be a challenge and way out my comfort zone. Still, I think, the benefits from doing such a move are going to be huge. I must not miss that opportunity.</li>\n<li>It's been a long time now since I wanted to be in a better physical shape. Unfortunately, 2015 wasn't the year for that. I am following a good diet and I am not eating much of junk no more. But I really need  to invest on the weight lifting more. 2016 will be the year for that.</li>\n</ul>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Laugh at perfection.
