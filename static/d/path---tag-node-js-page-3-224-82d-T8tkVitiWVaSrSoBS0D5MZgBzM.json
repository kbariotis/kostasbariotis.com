The trap? I had to present it a week after. :/ At first, it looked not such an easy task, since I hadn't have any slides or anything ready for it. Fuck it. Challenge accepted.</p>\n<p>I strongly believe that it’s the pressure that makes you a better professional let alone a better person. Life doesn’t wait. Let alone the community. Of course, I would be more pleased if I had the time to prepare a better presentation. But even this way I think it was a great experience. People liked it.</p>\n<p>Thanasis offered me even an easier solution. Take a ready presentation, study it and present it. Nah, I didn’t want it that way. I need it to be me. To have my own slides. My own talk. After all it’s me who had to present it. It had to had my style.</p>\n<p>Anyway, people asked for the <a href=\"http://slides.com/kostasbariotis/javascript-101\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">slides</a> and for some references.

From the homepage:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY FOR BUILDING USER INTERFACES</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You won't be able to use it on it's own. React is a library. People refer to it as the <a href=\"http://blog.codinghorror.com/understanding-model-view-controller/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>V</strong></a> from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>MVC</strong></a>. But even as is, it does a hell of amazing job. Here's why.</p>\n<h2 id=\"react-components\"><a href=\"#react-components\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>React Components</h2>\n<p>React consists of components. You may have already heard about <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Web Components</a> that  allow us to create custom HTML tags and include them anywhere on the outside world as easile as we include an <code class=\"language-text\">H1</code> tag. React components work just like this but can only be used inside the React ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Facebook implemented a <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/jsx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new syntax language</a> based on XML in order to compile their new XML based Components into vanilla Javascript. By doing this, we are able to write HTML inside Javascript and not being worry about it.</p>\n<p>What? Did I just say HTML inside Javascript? Isn't that against the whole MVC movement? Well sort of... But React's team thinks this wa,y we will be able to maintain our code more easily since it exists on fewer files. Newcomers will get their hands on our code more quickly.The new language JSX looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\">\n      <pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\">React<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">render</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>\n\t<span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>h1<span class=\"token operator\">></span>Hello<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> world<span class=\"token operator\">!</span><span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span>h1<span class=\"token operator\">></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    document<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">getElementById</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'example'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Lets talk a little bit more about the components. A component is basically a Javascript class that only knows how to render itself. A component can also contain child components it communicates with. This can help us write more modular code.</p>\n<p>Think of a <code class=\"language-text\">List</code> element. We will write a List component that will contain a <code class=\"language-text\">ListItem</code> component. Every time we need to display it, the <code class=\"language-text\">List</code> component will render a <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;ul/&gt;</code> tag with a bunch of <code class=\"language-text\">ListItem</code> components,, and each of these <code class=\"language-text\">ListItem</code>s will render <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;li/&gt;</code>, each with their information.</p>\n<p>But wait? Did you said... render... every time? Like every time someone adds something in the list we will rerender it?</p>\n<h2 id=\"reconciliation\"><a href=\"#reconciliation\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Reconciliation</h2>\n<p>Enter the <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reconciliation.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Virtual DOM magic, or in React's terms, the Reconciliation</a>. The essence of React. React will not render directly to the DOM every time something changes. Instead, it will render to its own internal DOM (the Virtual DOM) and then  compute diffs on the real DOM. React makes only the appropriate changes to the DOM to reflect the new changes. We never have to interact with the DOM again. We may never even have to write external stylesheets.

There are a lot of concepts you need to understand in order to grasp its full potential.</p>\n<p>As I said, in the beginning, it was <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">react-native</a> that forced me to play with React. But there are a <a href=\"http://blog.risingstack.com/from-angularjs-to-react-the-isomorphic-way/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lot</a> <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/flux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">more</a> goodies to explore and I haven't play with all of them yet.\nUntil next time, take care!</p>\n<p><em>Please let me know if I missed or misunderstood something, since it's my second day using React.

The trap? I had to present it a week after. :/ At first, it looked not such an easy task, since I hadn't have any slides or anything ready for it. Fuck it. Challenge accepted.</p>\n<p>I strongly believe that it’s the pressure that makes you a better professional let alone a better person. Life doesn’t wait. Let alone the community. Of course, I would be more pleased if I had the time to prepare a better presentation. But even this way I think it was a great experience. People liked it.</p>\n<p>Thanasis offered me even an easier solution. Take a ready presentation, study it and present it. Nah, I didn’t want it that way. I need it to be me. To have my own slides. My own talk. After all it’s me who had to present it. It had to had my style.</p>\n<p>Anyway, people asked for the <a href=\"http://slides.com/kostasbariotis/javascript-101\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">slides</a> and for some references.

From the homepage:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A JAVASCRIPT LIBRARY FOR BUILDING USER INTERFACES</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>You won't be able to use it on it's own. React is a library. People refer to it as the <a href=\"http://blog.codinghorror.com/understanding-model-view-controller/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>V</strong></a> from the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><strong>MVC</strong></a>. But even as is, it does a hell of amazing job. Here's why.</p>\n<h2 id=\"react-components\"><a href=\"#react-components\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>React Components</h2>\n<p>React consists of components. You may have already heard about <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Web_Components\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Web Components</a> that  allow us to create custom HTML tags and include them anywhere on the outside world as easile as we include an <code class=\"language-text\">H1</code> tag. React components work just like this but can only be used inside the React ecosystem.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, Facebook implemented a <a href=\"http://facebook.github.io/jsx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">new syntax language</a> based on XML in order to compile their new XML based Components into vanilla Javascript. By doing this, we are able to write HTML inside Javascript and not being worry about it.</p>\n<p>What? Did I just say HTML inside Javascript? Isn't that against the whole MVC movement? Well sort of... But React's team thinks this wa,y we will be able to maintain our code more easily since it exists on fewer files. Newcomers will get their hands on our code more quickly.The new language JSX looks like this:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"js\">\n      <pre class=\"language-js\"><code class=\"language-js\">React<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">render</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>\n\t<span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span>h1<span class=\"token operator\">></span>Hello<span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span> world<span class=\"token operator\">!</span><span class=\"token operator\">&lt;</span><span class=\"token operator\">/</span>h1<span class=\"token operator\">></span><span class=\"token punctuation\">,</span>\n    document<span class=\"token punctuation\">.</span><span class=\"token function\">getElementById</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span><span class=\"token string\">'example'</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">;</span></code></pre>\n      </div>\n<p>Lets talk a little bit more about the components. A component is basically a Javascript class that only knows how to render itself. A component can also contain child components it communicates with. This can help us write more modular code.</p>\n<p>Think of a <code class=\"language-text\">List</code> element. We will write a List component that will contain a <code class=\"language-text\">ListItem</code> component. Every time we need to display it, the <code class=\"language-text\">List</code> component will render a <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;ul/&gt;</code> tag with a bunch of <code class=\"language-text\">ListItem</code> components,, and each of these <code class=\"language-text\">ListItem</code>s will render <code class=\"language-text\">&lt;li/&gt;</code>, each with their information.</p>\n<p>But wait? Did you said... render... every time? Like every time someone adds something in the list we will rerender it?</p>\n<h2 id=\"reconciliation\"><a href=\"#reconciliation\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Reconciliation</h2>\n<p>Enter the <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reconciliation.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Virtual DOM magic, or in React's terms, the Reconciliation</a>. The essence of React. React will not render directly to the DOM every time something changes. Instead, it will render to its own internal DOM (the Virtual DOM) and then  compute diffs on the real DOM. React makes only the appropriate changes to the DOM to reflect the new changes. We never have to interact with the DOM again. We may never even have to write external stylesheets.

There are a lot of concepts you need to understand in order to grasp its full potential.</p>\n<p>As I said, in the beginning, it was <a href=\"https://github.com/facebook/react-native\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">react-native</a> that forced me to play with React. But there are a <a href=\"http://blog.risingstack.com/from-angularjs-to-react-the-isomorphic-way/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lot</a> <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/flux/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">more</a> goodies to explore and I haven't play with all of them yet.\nUntil next time, take care!</p>\n<p><em>Please let me know if I missed or misunderstood something, since it's my second day using React.
