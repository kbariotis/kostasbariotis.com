Instead of taking certain test cases, we are instructing our system to take different values and test against them. This way we can even find cases that we didn't thought.

While a possible good answer could be \"As much as you can\" this is often not the case. Testing can't always be a priority. There is a point in the size of every test suite that once we pass it, there is no more the need to test. Unless new requirements are introduced, we are running the suite to be sure that nothing breaks.</p>\n<p>Before you try to answer the \"how much to test\", let's take a look into the \"what to test\". The concept says that to put minimum effort and investment into manual and GUI testing, we should invest into the lower levels. Manual is by default more expensive and more fault tolerant. Bugs are more possible to pass by manual tests than automated unit tests.</p>\n<p>We can't eliminate manual testing and surely we can't automate it. But we can be sure that having a stronger automated test foundation we leave fewer errors to be found in the upper levels of testing.</p>","id":"5c6ee6a7-91ff-553d-ba85-521890c2feed","timeToRead":3,"frontmatter":{"date":"2016-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","path":"/drafts/testing/","tags":null,"title":"Testing Software Systems","draft":true}},{"excerpt":"Last week, me and Goodvidio's CTO sit down to come up with a solution.

This means that each of our applications (otherwise services) define their actions that want our service to track. There are no limitations, validations or anything like that. There are rules that must be followed but other than that, you are free to track what ever you want.</li>\n<li>We found a solution to allow the presenter of the audits to not have to render the message it self, instead we are generating a message directly from the data we receive so the presenter can take ready messages to display. Of course, it has the choice to rerender them itself.</li>\n</ul>","id":"f22ae3a1-de44-55b0-ae7f-06b40ce65ab4","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"date":"2015-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","path":"/drafts/our-auditing-service/","tags":null,"title":"Our auditing service","draft":true}},{"excerpt":"With the rise of the upcoming  WebWorkers API  in the horizon, interesting things are emerging.

And the one that got me go \"whhaaaaat??\" is the one that advices you to put all of your business logic inside a WebWorker. Whaaaaat?</p>\n<p>A WebWorker is a separate thread that runs Javascript but has no access to the DOM or the <code class=\"language-text\">window</code> object. But it can do complex queries and loops, accessing core <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Functions_and_classes_available_to_workers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">functions and APIs</a>, while you are letting the main thread, the UI thread, to handle the UI stuff only.</p>\n<p>Rendering the DOM is so expensive, specially when it comes to complex interfaces we have nowadays. Not so long ago, the <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reconciliation.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">VirtualDOM</a> introduced which tried to speed up the rendering process by rendering only what actually changed, instead of re-rendering the whole page. But, that's not enough apparently, since even such few changes can't be handle well by low powered devices such as mobiles phones and watches.</p>\n<p>In order to keep the 60fpm barrier, we are completely freeing the main thread to be able to handle the rendering only and we start WebWorkers to handle our business logic.</p>\n<p>I found <a href=\"http://www.pocketjavascript.com/blog/2015/11/23/introducing-pokedex-org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">two</a> <a href=\"https://medium.com/@nsisodiya/flux-inside-web-workers-cc51fb463882#.iv69h6ih2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">great</a> examples of this concept. Both, they are suggesting keeping the whole app outside the main thread and send there only the patch of the changed DOM to be rendered. The UI thread can then handle only rendering and complex fancy animations.</p>\n<p>Oh, by the way, Nodejs fans, <a href=\"https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2133\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Workers are coming</a>.</p>","id":"590dc4f2-6a4a-5dc1-af8d-6f92ba914aaf","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"date":"2015-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","path":"/drafts/ui-thread-free/","tags":null,"title":"UI thread free","draft":true}},{"excerpt":"dont do word wrap and leave your lines huge\nfind how your language handles multilne strings\nexamples on JS/PHP/etc dont keep global state. avoid it in any situation\nuse pure functions and flow the state through them.","html":"<p>dont do word wrap and leave your lines huge\nfind how your language handles multilne strings\nexamples on JS/PHP/etc</p>\n<p>dont keep global state. avoid it in any situation\nuse pure functions and flow the state through them.</p>","id":"be2ffd94-0de6-5964-b1a2-9f3048f8abae","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"date":"2015-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","path":"/drafts/what-not-to-do-for-beginners/","tags":null,"title":"What not to do for beginners","draft":true}}],"page":3,"pagesSum":4,"prevPath":"/drafts/page/2","nextPath":"/drafts/page/4"},"updatedAt":1529439932644,"pluginCreator___NODE":"Plugin gatsby-plugin-paginate","pluginCreatorId":"Plugin gatsby-plugin-paginate","componentPath":"/home/travis/build/kbariotis/kostasbariotis.com/src/templates/page.js","posts":[{"excerpt":"The Error object","html":"<p>The Error object</p>","id":"def53fba-00b8-525c-bbc2-8110fb12e111","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"date":"2016-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","path":"/drafts/the-error-object-in-javascript/","tags":null,"title":"The error object in Javascript","draft":true}},{"excerpt":"A few weeks ago, I did my Microservices talk at Thessaloniki's Ruby meetup.

Instead of taking certain test cases, we are instructing our system to take different values and test against them. This way we can even find cases that we didn't thought. Property testing can be applied at any level of our test suite.</p>\n<h1 id=\"how-much-to-test\"><a href=\"#how-much-to-test\" aria-hidden=\"true\" class=\"anchor\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>How much to test</h1>\n<p>A question that usually shows up is \"How much should I be testing\". While a possible good answer could be \"As much as you can\" this is often not the case. Testing can't always be a priority. There is a point in the size of every test suite that once we pass it, there is no more the need to test. Unless new requirements are introduced, we are running the suite to be sure that nothing breaks.</p>\n<p>Before you try to answer the \"how much to test\", let's take a look into the \"what to test\". The concept says that to put minimum effort and investment into manual and GUI testing, we should invest into the lower levels. Manual is by default more expensive and more fault tolerant. Bugs are more possible to pass by manual tests than automated unit tests.</p>\n<p>We can't eliminate manual testing and surely we can't automate it. But we can be sure that having a stronger automated test foundation we leave fewer errors to be found in the upper levels of testing.</p>","id":"5c6ee6a7-91ff-553d-ba85-521890c2feed","timeToRead":3,"frontmatter":{"date":"2016-05-01T00:00:00.000Z","path":"/drafts/testing/","tags":null,"title":"Testing Software Systems","draft":true}},{"excerpt":"Last week, me and Goodvidio's CTO sit down to come up with a solution.

We were in a need of an auditing service that will track down every movement inside our system.</p>\n<p>Searching in Google we didn't find any real world example either any useful information as we expected. We had only our experience from the various systems we've used and how they are implementing such things. But again, we had never meet an isolated auditing service. That was our goal.</p>\n<p>Here are my notes from the meeting.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Our goal was to track down actions happens anywhere in the system</li>\n<li>We should track the action, the actor of that action(whether it's an actual user or another service) and a lot of metadata about the action.</li>\n<li>Actions are application level logic. This means that each of our applications (otherwise services) define their actions that want our service to track. There are no limitations, validations or anything like that. There are rules that must be followed but other than that, you are free to track what ever you want.</li>\n<li>We found a solution to allow the presenter of the audits to not have to render the message it self, instead we are generating a message directly from the data we receive so the presenter can take ready messages to display. Of course, it has the choice to rerender them itself.</li>\n</ul>","id":"f22ae3a1-de44-55b0-ae7f-06b40ce65ab4","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"date":"2015-11-15T00:00:00.000Z","path":"/drafts/our-auditing-service/","tags":null,"title":"Our auditing service","draft":true}},{"excerpt":"With the rise of the upcoming  WebWorkers API  in the horizon, interesting things are emerging.

And the one that got me go \"whhaaaaat??\" is the one that advices you to put all of your business logic inside a WebWorker. Whaaaaat?</p>\n<p>A WebWorker is a separate thread that runs Javascript but has no access to the DOM or the <code class=\"language-text\">window</code> object. But it can do complex queries and loops, accessing core <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Functions_and_classes_available_to_workers\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">functions and APIs</a>, while you are letting the main thread, the UI thread, to handle the UI stuff only.</p>\n<p>Rendering the DOM is so expensive, specially when it comes to complex interfaces we have nowadays. Not so long ago, the <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/reconciliation.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">VirtualDOM</a> introduced which tried to speed up the rendering process by rendering only what actually changed, instead of re-rendering the whole page. But, that's not enough apparently, since even such few changes can't be handle well by low powered devices such as mobiles phones and watches.</p>\n<p>In order to keep the 60fpm barrier, we are completely freeing the main thread to be able to handle the rendering only and we start WebWorkers to handle our business logic.</p>\n<p>I found <a href=\"http://www.pocketjavascript.com/blog/2015/11/23/introducing-pokedex-org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">two</a> <a href=\"https://medium.com/@nsisodiya/flux-inside-web-workers-cc51fb463882#.iv69h6ih2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">great</a> examples of this concept. Both, they are suggesting keeping the whole app outside the main thread and send there only the patch of the changed DOM to be rendered. The UI thread can then handle only rendering and complex fancy animations.</p>\n<p>Oh, by the way, Nodejs fans, <a href=\"https://github.com/nodejs/node/pull/2133\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Workers are coming</a>.</p>","id":"590dc4f2-6a4a-5dc1-af8d-6f92ba914aaf","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"date":"2015-10-15T00:00:00.000Z","path":"/drafts/ui-thread-free/","tags":null,"title":"UI thread free","draft":true}},{"excerpt":"dont do word wrap and leave your lines huge\nfind how your language handles multilne strings\nexamples on JS/PHP/etc dont keep global state. avoid it in any situation\nuse pure functions and flow the state through them.","html":"<p>dont do word wrap and leave your lines huge\nfind how your language handles multilne strings\nexamples on JS/PHP/etc</p>\n<p>dont keep global state. avoid it in any situation\nuse pure functions and flow the state through them.</p>","id":"be2ffd94-0de6-5964-b1a2-9f3048f8abae","timeToRead":1,"frontmatter":{"date":"2015-10-10T00:00:00.000Z","path":"/drafts/what-not-to-do-for-beginners/","tags":null,"title":"What not to do for beginners","draft":true}}],"page":3,"pagesSum":4,"prevPath":"/drafts/page/2","nextPath":"/drafts/page/4"}}
